# RealReports

Inspired by my experience in commercial real estate management, RealReports is a project management and reporting application featuring user email inbox integration via Google's Gmail API.

Users are able to create, track, update, and close out projects using information from their emails or through manual input. From there, reports showcasing completed projects can be created for distribution.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
